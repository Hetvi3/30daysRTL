# ðŸš€ 30 Days of RTL Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Days of RTL Challenge**! ðŸš€  
This repository contains implementation of  various concepts in **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** design using **Verilog HDL** on Quartus and ModelSim Altera over the span of 30 days.  

The goal is to build a strong foundation in **digital design** and **hardware description languages** by practicing one module, problem, or concept each day.
